# Dependency Reduction Notes

**Date:** 2026-07-25

## Purpose

Kirjolab has grown beyond 100,000 lines across source, tests, and tooling. The
goal of dependency adoption is not to minimize the repository mechanically. It
is to retire project-owned implementations of commodity infrastructure while
keeping product rules, security bounds, and durable authorities explicit.

The current codebase is large but not broadly unhealthy. The local Fallow
diagnostics report an 81/B health score, average cyclomatic complexity of 3,
5% duplication, and one dominant churn hotspot: `src/client/app.ts`.

## Evidence

- Runtime validation is distributed across 203 `is…`, `parse…`, `validate…`,
  and `assert…` functions. Forty-three files define their own `isRecord`
  helper.
- `src/client/app.ts` is 12,495 lines and combines a large typed element
  registry with event binding, rendering, and feature orchestration.
- `src/integrations/github-app.ts` and
  `src/integrations/github-user.ts` contain about 860 lines of handwritten
  GitHub authentication and REST protocol code.
- `src/domain/bibliography.ts` implements a deliberately bounded 240-line
  BibTeX parser and serializer.
- `src/client/offline-workspace.ts` contains about 70 lines of direct IndexedDB
  promise and transaction plumbing.

## Recommended Sequence

### 1. Pilot schema validation at one trust boundary

Adopt Valibot for a coherent family of external or persisted payloads. A schema
should become the single runtime contract and infer its TypeScript output type
where doing so removes a duplicated interface or type guard.

The pilot must:

- preserve all existing bounds and accepted payloads;
- remain local to one contract family;
- keep cross-record and stateful business invariants in domain functions;
- avoid converting internal predicates merely for consistency; and
- demonstrate a net reduction in maintained validation code.

The library-interchange boundary is the preferred pilot because its CSL JSON
and portable research payloads are explicit, versioned, and already covered by
focused tests and a living spec.

### 2. Pilot decomposed Octokit packages

Replace only commodity GitHub protocol work: App authentication, installation
tokens, authenticated request construction, and standard request errors. Keep
Kirjolab's repository selection, path normalization, content limits, response
normalization, concurrency checks, and safe public error mapping.

Prefer decomposed Octokit packages over the all-in-one SDK. Preserve injected
`fetch` support so tests and Workers runtime behavior remain deterministic.

### 3. Pilot one Lit component

Extract one bounded, low-coupling browser surface from `WorkspaceApp` into a
Lit custom element. The component should own its local template, element
references, reactive presentation state, and DOM events while emitting typed
intent events to the existing application coordinator.

The pilot must not:

- turn Lit into a global application store;
- move Yjs, XState actors, network authority, or persisted domain state into
  the component;
- require client-side ownership of the whole server-rendered shell; or
- introduce a second visual language.

The GitHub connection/import presentation is the preferred pilot because it
has bounded state, explicit user intents, and existing contract tests.

## Deferred Options

- Adopt Citation.js only when broader BibTeX, BibLaTeX, RIS, or CSL
  interoperability becomes a product requirement. The current bounded parser
  is smaller than the adaptation layer would likely be today.
- Adopt `idb` when a second browser database store or schema migration appears.
  The current saving is too small to justify a dependency by itself.
- Do not adopt a Worker router solely to reduce conditional route matching.
  Most API volume is authorization and product workflow logic.
- Keep explicit LaTeX ZIP envelope validation. It enforces Kirjolab-specific
  security and resource bounds beyond decompression.

## Evaluation Gates

Each pilot receives its own commit and must pass targeted tests, affected
guardrails, and the full native local CI gate before the sequence is considered
ready. Record lasting constraints in an ADR and update the affected feature spec
in the same commit as the implementation.

Continue to the next pilot only when the preceding change preserves behavior
and leaves a narrower project-owned maintenance surface. A pilot that adds
abstraction without deleting equivalent infrastructure should be reverted or
kept out of the production path.
